# Sony SRG-A40 / SRG-A12 VISCA IP Control SIMPL+ Module

# 

# Version: 1.1

# Overview

# 

# This Crestron SIMPL+ module provides comprehensive and robust control for Sony SRG-A40 and SRG-A12 PTZ cameras over a standard TCP/IP network using the VISCA protocol.

# 

# The module is designed for professional AV integration, offering discrete commands for nearly all camera functions and providing real-time feedback. A core feature is its seamless integration with the Crestron C2N-CAMIDJ joystick, enabling an intuitive and tactile control experience for camera operators.

# Key Features

# 

# &nbsp;   Full PTZF Control: Smooth, variable-speed pan, tilt, zoom, and focus control.

# 

# &nbsp;   Extensive CCU Settings: Access and adjust a wide range of image parameters, including:

# 

# &nbsp;       Exposure (Auto, Manual, Shutter/Iris Priority)

# 

# &nbsp;       White Balance (Auto, Presets, One-Push, Manual)

# 

# &nbsp;       Gain, Iris, Shutter, and Aperture

# 

# &nbsp;       Image enhancements like WDR, Backlight Compensation, and High Sensitivity.

# 

# &nbsp;   Advanced Preset Management: Store, recall, and clear up to 256 presets.

# 

# &nbsp;   C2N-CAMIDJ Joystick Integration:

# 

# &nbsp;       Mode-based control for PTZ speed, focus, and iris.

# 

# &nbsp;       Automatic feedback to the joystick's LEDs and digital display.

# 

# &nbsp;       On-the-fly speed adjustments using the joystick wheel.

# 

# &nbsp;   Robust Communication:

# 

# &nbsp;       Manages VISCA over IP sequence numbering and packet formatting.

# 

# &nbsp;       Automatic keep-alive polling to monitor the camera's connection status.

# 

# &nbsp;       Re-initializes the connection if communication is lost.

# 

# &nbsp;   Additional Controls:

# 

# &nbsp;       Auto Framing activation and deactivation.

# 

# &nbsp;       Tally light control with a keep-alive mechanism.

# 

# &nbsp;       Video Mute, Image Flip, and more.

# 

# Compatibility

# 

# &nbsp;   Primary: Sony SRG-A40, Sony SRG-A12

# 

# &nbsp;   Protocol: VISCA over IP

# 

# While other Sony VISCA over IP cameras may respond to basic commands, full functionality is only guaranteed for the primary models listed.

# Getting Started

# 

# &nbsp;   Add to SIMPL Program: Add a TCP/IP Client device to your SIMPL program. Set its IP Address to the static IP of the Sony camera and the port to 52381.

# 

# &nbsp;   Insert Module: Drag the Sony SRG-A40 A12 VISCA IP C2N-CAMIDJ v1.1.usp module from your user modules into the Logic folder of your program.

# 

# &nbsp;   Connect Communication:

# 

# &nbsp;       Connect the To\_Camera\_tx$ output of the module to the TX$ input of the TCP/IP Client.

# 

# &nbsp;       Connect the RX$ output of the TCP/IP Client to the From\_Camera\_rx$ input of the module.

# 

# &nbsp;   Control \& Feedback: Connect your control system logic (e.g., from a touch panel) to the various \_trig inputs on the module. Use the \_fb outputs to drive feedback on your user interface.

# 

# &nbsp;   C2N-CAMIDJ (Optional): If using a joystick, add a C2N-CAMIDJ symbol to your program and connect its analog and digital outputs to the corresponding C2N\_CAMIDJ\_ inputs on this module. Connect the module's C2N\_CAMIDJ\_ feedback outputs back to the joystick symbol.

# 

# Operations

# Initialization

# 

# The module automatically handles the connection and initialization process. Upon a successful TCP/IP connection, it resets the VISCA sequence number and queries all camera states to synchronize feedback.

# C2N-CAMIDJ Joystick

# 

# The joystick provides an intuitive way to operate the camera:

# 

# &nbsp;   Mode Buttons (Focus, Pan, Tilt, Zoom): Select what the joystick and wheel will control.

# 

# &nbsp;   Speed Buttons (Fast/Slow): Select the active speed profile for PTZ movements.

# 

# &nbsp;   Wheel:

# 

# &nbsp;       In Focus or Iris mode, the wheel directly adjusts the setting.

# 

# &nbsp;       In a Speed mode, press and turn the wheel to change the speed value for the currently selected profile (Fast or Slow). The value is shown on the joystick's display.

# 

# &nbsp;   Timeout: The joystick mode automatically reverts to its default state after 30 seconds of inactivity to prevent accidental adjustments.

# 

# Troubleshooting

# 

# The Debug\_fb$ string output is the primary tool for troubleshooting. Connect it to a "Serial/ASCII Send" symbol (or view it in SIMPL Debugger) to see:

# 

# &nbsp;   Formatted commands being sent to the camera.

# 

# &nbsp;   Parsed responses received from the camera.

# 

# &nbsp;   Connection status and error messages (e.g., timeouts).

# 

# If the module fails to connect or control the camera, verify the IP Address and Port on the TCP/IP Client symbol and ensure the camera is on the network and accessible.
